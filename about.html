                         Now, this is a story all about how
                            My life got flipped-turned upside down
                            And I liked to take a minute
                            Just sit right there
                            I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
                            In west Philadelphia born and raised
                            On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                            Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                            And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
                            When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                            Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                            She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
                            I begged and pleaded with her day after day
                            But she packed my suite case and send me on my way
                            She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
                            I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'
